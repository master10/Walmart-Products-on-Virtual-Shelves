The above table describes about the feature name and the total number of 'Nan' values present in them. Total number of rows present in the data were 10593.

Features which had comparatively less number of 'Nan' in them.
Following were the features selected :
1. Seller, 
2. Item Class ID, 
3. Product Long Description, 
3. Product Name, 
4. Product Short Description, 
5. Short Description

For all the features except Item class ID, the following was done:
1. HTML tags were removed.
2. Only letters were retained
3. stops words were removed
4. stemming was done

To this corpus, Item class Id was appended because these were the only numbers we wanted to retain the feature set.
Bag of words was then made for construction of features.
After construction of features, ensemble method of developing models was used.
It consisted of following models:
1. random forest,
2. naive bayes
3. Extra trees
4. svm with linear kernel


The tags which were voted by 2 out of 5 models were predicted as the virtual shelf for the test set.
